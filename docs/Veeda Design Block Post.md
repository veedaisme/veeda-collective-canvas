### **Design Document: Flexible Grid Canvas Representation for Suggestions**

---

#### **Project Overview**

This design document outlines the approach to represent a flexible grid canvas as suggestions for other users. The goal is to enable users to discover and interact with content created within the flexible grid canvas in an intuitive, engaging, and efficient manner.

---

### **1\. Problem Statement**

Representing a flexible grid canvas in a suggestion format is challenging due to:

* The complexity of visualizing flexibility and modularity.  
* Communicating the value of the content within the canvas.  
* Balancing simplicity with detailed representation.

---

### **2\. Objectives**

* Create a user-friendly system to display flexible grid canvas content as suggestions.  
* Provide options for users to interact with either granular block-level content or high-level canvas titles.  
* Ensure seamless integration into the platform’s existing UI/UX.

---

### **3\. Proposed Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Post-Like Content Based on Blocks**

* **Description**: Extract blocks from the flexible grid canvas and display them as modular post-like snippets in suggestions.  
* **Key Features**:  
  * Each block becomes a standalone preview (e.g., text, image, data).  
  * Interactive previews allow users to click for more details.  
  * Blocks are styled consistently with the platform’s design language.  
* **Advantages**:  
  * Granular visibility into canvas content.  
  * Encourages user engagement with specific blocks.  
* **Challenges**:  
  * Requires dynamic rendering of blocks into posts.  
  * May overwhelm users if too many blocks are displayed.

#### **Option 2: Display Canvas Title Only**

* **Description**: Show only the title of the flexible grid canvas in suggestions. Users click on the title to open and explore the full canvas.  
* **Key Features**:  
  * Titles are manually or dynamically generated based on canvas content.  
  * Minimalistic design ensures clarity and simplicity in suggestions.  
* **Advantages**:  
  * Clean and straightforward representation.  
  * Reduces cognitive load for users browsing suggestions.  
* **Challenges**:  
  * Limited visibility into the actual content of the canvas.

#### **Hybrid Approach**

Combine both options by allowing users to toggle between viewing post-like snippets and just titles. This provides flexibility based on user preferences.

### **4\. User Flow**

#### **For Post-Like Content Representation**

1. User creates a flexible grid canvas with multiple blocks.  
2. System extracts block-level content (text, images, etc.).  
3. Blocks are rendered as modular posts in suggestions (with previews).  
4. Other users interact with these posts by clicking for more details or opening the full canvas.

#### **For Title Representation**

1. User assigns a title to their flexible grid canvas (or system generates one dynamically).  
2. Title appears in suggestions as a clickable link.  
3. Other users click on the title to open and explore the full canvas.

---

### **5\. Design Components**

#### **UI Elements**

1. **Post-Like Snippets**:  
   * Thumbnail preview for images or media blocks.  
   * Text excerpts for text-based blocks.  
   * Icons or tags indicating block type (e.g., image, text, chart).  
2. **Canvas Title**:  
   * Bold, clickable text representing the title of the canvas.  
   * Optional description or metadata (e.g., creation date, tags).

#### **Interaction States**

* Hover effects for previews (e.g., zoom-in or highlight).  
* Click actions:  
  * For snippets: Open detailed block view or full canvas.  
  * For titles: Navigate directly to full canvas view.

---

### **6\. Technical Requirements**

#### **Backend**

* Dynamic extraction of block content from flexible grid canvases.  
* Metadata generation for titles (if automated).

#### **Frontend**

* Responsive design for post-like snippets and titles.  
* Toggle functionality between snippet view and title-only view.

#### **Performance Optimization**

* Lazy loading for block previews to minimize impact on performance.  
* Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed canvases.

---

### **7\. Success Metrics**

To evaluate success, track:

1. User engagement rates (clicks on snippets/titles).  
2. Time spent exploring canvases from suggestions.  
3. Feedback on clarity and usability of suggestion representations.

---

### **8\. Mockup Examples**

| Representation Type | Example UI |
| :---- | :---- |
| Post-Like Content | \[Thumbnail \+ Text Excerpt\] |
| Canvas Title | \[Bold Title \+ Metadata\] |

---

### **9\. Next Steps**

1. Create wireframes for both representation types.  
2. Develop prototypes and conduct user testing sessions.  
3. Refine based on feedback and finalize implementation strategy.
