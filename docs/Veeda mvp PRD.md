## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Veeda, formerly known as Collective Canvas. Veeda aims to be a mindful digital space for organizing thoughts, brainstorming, and knowledge building with an emphasis on intentionality, context, and simplicity.

The MVP will focus on establishing the core user experience of creating, organizing, and connecting information blocks within a personal canvas. This document serves as the primary reference for the product team during the development phase.

## 2. Product Overview

Veeda is a digital platform designed for creative individuals, professionals, philosophers, and anyone interested in organizing their thoughts for brainstorming and knowledge building. It provides a distinctive digital space for mindful curation, personal reflection, and idea organization.

The MVP will deliver the fundamental canvas-based experience where users can create and arrange blocks of information, draw meaningful connections between them, and add contextual notes and reflectionsâ€”all within a clean, intentional interface that prioritizes content over features.

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals:
- Deliver a functional core experience for creating and organizing information blocks
- Implement a visual connection system between blocks
- Establish the block immutability principle (non-deletion)
- Create a clean, intuitive user interface
- Build a foundation for future feature expansion

### Success Metrics:
- User registration and retention
- Number of canvases created per user
- Number of blocks created per canvas
- Time spent organizing and connecting blocks
- User feedback on core experience (satisfaction with block creation, connection features)

<a name="target-audience"></a>
## 4. Target Audience (MVP Focus)

The MVP will primarily target:
- Individual users seeking a personal tool to visually organize ideas
- Creative professionals (designers, writers, etc.) looking for a digital thinking space
- Researchers and academics needing to organize research materials and notes
- Knowledge workers wanting to build connections between information snippets
- Lifelong learners seeking to organize study materials and insights

<a name="core-principles"></a>
## 5. Core Principles (MVP Focus)

### Intentionality
- Encourage deliberate content creation through the non-deletion model
- Promote thoughtful arrangement and connection of ideas

### Meaning and Context
- Enable users to build context by visually connecting related blocks
- Allow for the addition of reflections and notes to provide meaning to content

### Simplicity and Clarity
- Provide a clean, distraction-free interface
- Focus on content organization rather than complex features
- Ensure intuitive interactions for core functionality

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Usability
- The interface must be intuitive, clean, and minimalist
- Content should be prioritized over UI elements
- First-time users should be able to create a canvas with blocks without a tutorial
- Interface elements should have clear affordances (what can be clicked/dragged)

### 7.2 Reliability
- The system must reliably save user data (canvases, blocks, connections, notes)
- Block immutability (no deletion) must be strictly enforced
- Auto-save functionality should prevent data loss
- Users should receive clear confirmation when changes are saved

### 7.3 Performance
- Basic interactions should feel responsive (< 200ms)
- Canvas loading should be reasonably fast for up to 100 blocks
- Block creation and editing should have minimal latency
- Image uploads should show clear progress indicators

### 7.4 Compatibility
- The MVP should function on modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- The interface should be responsive for different screen sizes (min. 1024px width)

<a name="design-considerations"></a>
## 8. Design Considerations

### 8.1 Grid System
- Implement a flexible grid system for block arrangement
- Allow free-form placement while maintaining alignment options
- Grid should be visible but unobtrusive

### 8.2 Visual Language
- Develop a clean, minimalist visual language that emphasizes content
- Ensure adequate contrast for readability
- Use visual affordances to indicate interactive elements

### 8.3 Block Design
- Create a consistent visual design for different block types
- Clearly differentiate block types (text, image, link)
- Visually indicate the non-deletable nature of blocks

### 8.4 Connection Visualization
- Design clear visual representations for connections between blocks
- Ensure connections remain visible even when blocks are moved
- Provide intuitive interaction for creating/removing connections

## 10. Timeline and Milestones

A high-level timeline with key milestones will be determined after initial team planning and will be added as an appendix to this document.

<a name="risks-and-mitigations"></a>
## 11. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| User resistance to block non-deletion | User frustration, reduced adoption | Clear explanation during onboarding, implementation of grace period, emphasis on benefits |
| Performance issues with large canvases | Poor user experience, frustration | Implement pagination or virtualization for large canvases, optimize rendering |
| User confusion with the canvas paradigm | Reduced engagement, higher churn | Intuitive design, subtle guidance elements, focused onboarding |
| Security concerns with shared canvases | Privacy breaches, loss of trust | Clear sharing controls, visual indicators for public content |
